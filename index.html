                    <li>Focused on comparison of the speed of two encryption algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Divided the original data into blocks with the help of encryption keys, the keys that are generated by using the algorithms(twofish and blowfish) and tested with different types of image files to compare the encryption and decryptiontimingsoftwo algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Encrypted and Decrypted various image files of different sizes using Encryption and Decryption Algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Concluded that for image encryption and decryption twofish requires more time when compared with blowfishalgorithm</li>
